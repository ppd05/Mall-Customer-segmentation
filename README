# Mall Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on performing customer segmentation on a dataset of mall customers. The goal is to identify distinct groups of customers based on their `Annual Income` and `Spending Score`, which can help the mall's marketing team create targeted strategies for each segment.

## Dataset
The dataset used is `mall_customrs.csv`, which contains information about mall customers, including:
- `CustomerID`: Unique identifier for each customer.
- `Gender`: Gender of the customer.
- `Age`: Age of the customer.
- `Annual Income (k$)`: Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.
- `Spending Score (1-100)`: A score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending habits.

## Methodology
The analysis was performed using the following steps:
1.  **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**: Initial examination of the data, checking for missing values, and understanding the distribution of key variables.
2.  **Feature Selection**: `Annual Income (k$)` and `Spending Score (1-100)` were chosen as the primary features for segmentation.
3.  **Clustering with K-Means**: The K-Means clustering algorithm was used to group customers.
    * **Finding the Optimal Number of Clusters**: The Elbow Method was applied to determine the ideal number of clusters ($k$).
4.  **Visualization**: The final clusters were visualized using scatter plots to clearly show the different customer segments.

## Results
The analysis successfully identified **five distinct customer segments**:
1.  **Segment 1**: [Describe this segment, e.g., High Income, Low Spenders].
2.  **Segment 2**: [Describe this segment, e.g., Average Income, Average Spenders].
3.  **Segment 3**: [Describe this segment, e.g., Low Income, Low Spenders].
4.  **Segment 4**: [Describe this segment, e.g., Low Income, High Spenders].
5.  **Segment 5**: [Describe this segment, e.g., High Income, High Spenders].

These segments can be used by the mall to create personalized marketing campaigns, loyalty programs, and product recommendations.

## Technologies and Libraries Used
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing the K-Means clustering algorithm.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
